### Scores by school spending

The scores within the middle spending ranges per student increased for both math and reading.

## Summary
When ninth grade scores were removed, the Overall Passing % for Thomas High School increased.  Since it is unknown which of the student grades had been altered, it was necessary to remove all of the scores for the entire grade.  This new percentage might be an exaggeration of actual performance and not accurately reflect how successful this school is.  The difference isn't too significant, so it didn't change many of the district wide results.
